      question: "Is paragliding safe?",
      answer: "When conducted with proper training, equipment, and weather conditions, paragliding is very safe. At GEP Paragliding, safety is our top priority. All our pilots are certified professionals, our equipment is regularly inspected and maintained, and we strictly adhere to weather guidelines. We won't fly if conditions aren't optimal for safety."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need any prior experience for a tandem flight?",
      answer: "No prior experience is needed for tandem flights. Our experienced pilots will handle the takeoff, flying, and landing while you enjoy the ride. You'll receive a brief instruction before takeoff about basic procedures and safety. All you need is a sense of adventure!"
    },
    {
      question: "What should I wear for paragliding?",
      answer: "Wear comfortable, weather-appropriate clothing. Long pants and closed-toe shoes with good ankle support are recommended. Dress in layers as temperatures can change with altitude. We provide helmets and harnesses. Don't forget sunglasses and sunscreen, even on cloudy days."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does a typical paragliding flight last?",
      answer: "Our standard tandem flights typically last 15-30 minutes, depending on weather conditions and thermal activity. We also offer extended flights of up to an hour for those wanting a more comprehensive experience. Training flights for students are usually shorter, focusing on specific skills development."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the age and weight restrictions?",
      answer: "For tandem flights, participants must be at least 12 years old (minors require parental consent). For solo training, the minimum age is 16. Weight restrictions typically range from 40kg to 110kg, depending on equipment and conditions. These limitations are for safety reasons and to ensure proper equipment functionality."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if the weather is bad on my booking date?",
      answer: "Safety is our priority, so we won't fly in unsuitable weather conditions. If we need to cancel due to weather, you can reschedule for another day at no extra cost or receive a full refund. We monitor weather forecasts closely and will contact you in advance if there's a potential issue with your booking date."

      question: "Will I feel scared or get motion sickness during the flight?",
      answer: "It's normal to feel a mixture of excitement and nervousness before your first flight. Most people find that any fear disappears once they're airborne and the smooth sensation of flight takes over. Motion sickness is uncommon in paragliding as the flight is generally stable, but if you're particularly prone to it, we recommend taking appropriate medication before flying and letting your pilot know."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I prepare for my first paragliding experience?",
      answer: "Get a good night's sleep before your flight, eat a light meal, and stay hydrated. Avoid alcohol the night before and on the day of your flight. Wear appropriate clothing and arrive at the scheduled time for your safety briefing. Most importantly, come with an open mind and be ready to follow your instructor's guidance."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between paragliding and hang gliding?",
      answer: "While both allow you to fly, paragliders use a flexible wing (similar to a parachute) that can be packed into a backpack, while hang gliders have a rigid aluminum frame with a sail-like wing. Paragliding is generally easier to learn, offers slower flying speeds, and requires less physical strength. Hang gliding can achieve higher speeds and greater distances but has a steeper learning curve."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I bring my camera or phone during the flight?",
      answer: "Yes, you can bring a small camera or phone to capture your experience, but it must be secured with a strap or lanyard to prevent dropping it. For safety reasons, you won't be able to hold items during takeoff and landing. We also offer professional photography and video services so you can fully enjoy the experience without worrying about capturing it yourself."

  courses: [
    {
      question: "How long does it take to learn to paraglide solo?",
      answer: "Our P1 Basic Course typically takes 5-7 days, after which most students can perform basic solo flights under supervision. To become a fully independent pilot (P3 level) usually takes several months of training and practice. Learning rate varies by individual, weather conditions, and frequency of practice."
    },
    {
      question: "What's included in the training courses?",
      answer: "All our courses include theoretical classroom sessions, practical ground handling training, and actual flying time. Equipment rental during the course, learning materials, and certification fees (where applicable) are included. Accommodation and meals are not included but can be arranged at additional cost. We provide all necessary safety equipment including helmets, harnesses, and radios."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to be physically fit to learn paragliding?",
      answer: "While you don't need to be an athlete, a basic level of fitness helps. You should be able to jog a short distance while carrying approximately 15kg of equipment and be comfortable standing for extended periods during ground handling practice. Upper body strength is less important than coordination and the ability to follow instructions precisely."
    },
    {
      question: "What certification do I receive after completing a course?",
      answer: "Upon successful completion of our courses, you receive certification according to international paragliding standards. Our P1 course gives you a basic pilot rating, P2 an intermediate rating, and P3 a full pilot rating. These certifications are recognized by paragliding associations worldwide and allow you to rent equipment and fly at most flying sites appropriate for your skill level."

  equipment: [
    {
      question: "What kind of equipment do you use for training and tandem flights?",
      answer: "We use only internationally certified, top-quality equipment from renowned manufacturers like Ozone, Advance, Nova, and Supair. Our wings (paragliders) are certified to EN/LTF standards, and we use modern harnesses with back protection. All equipment is regularly inspected and maintained according to manufacturer guidelines and safety standards."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does paragliding equipment last?",
      answer: "With proper care and maintenance, a paraglider wing typically lasts 300-500 flying hours or about 4-5 years of regular use. Harnesses can last longer, often 5-8 years. However, this varies based on usage frequency, storage conditions, exposure to UV, and whether any incidents occur. We recommend annual professional inspections of all equipment to ensure continued safety."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you sell equipment for students who want to purchase their own?",
      answer: "Yes, we have a pro shop where we sell both new and quality used equipment. For students who complete our courses, we offer personalized guidance on selecting appropriate gear matching their skill level and goals. We also provide package discounts for complete setups and can order specific models if they're not in stock."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I rent equipment after completing a course?",
      answer: "Absolutely! We offer equipment rental for certified pilots at daily or weekly rates. This is a great option for visiting pilots or recent graduates who aren't ready to invest in their own gear. Our rental fleet includes various wing models suitable for different pilot levels, along with harnesses, helmets, radios, and variometers."
